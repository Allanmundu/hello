            I’ve always been into cars. Cars are part of our genetic makeup. It’s unavoidable.
            
            I thought cars were essential ingredients of life itself.
            
            The cars we drive say a lot about us.” 
            
            “When a man opens a car door for his wife, it’s either a new car or a new wife.” 
            
            “Straight roads are for fast cars, turns are for fast drivers.” 
            
            “Race cars are neither beautiful nor ugly. They become beautiful when they win.” 
            
            “I am emotional about engines, if you hurt my car, you hurt my heart.” 
            
            “Leave sooner, drive slower, and live longer.” 
            
            “Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?”</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">People spend so much time in their cars, and it's a legal way to have fun by speeding a little bit or testing yourself a little bit, and you get to invest in your car. For some people, it becomes their baby.
            I once owned a really, really ugly pair of white leather boots. They were so bad. It was back in the '80s! It was just a really tacky fashion choice when I was in middle school, and I thought it was cool. I'm really embarrassed.
            I'm a mirror. If you're cool with me, I'm cool with you, and the exchange starts. What you see is what you reflect. If you don't like what you see, then you've done something. If I'm standoffish, that's because you are.
            It's so important to realize that every time you get upset, it drains your emotional energy. Losing your cool makes you tired. Getting angry a lot messes with your health.
            Fast cars are my only vice.Don’t dare to touch my car, because it has more importance than you in my life.You don’t have swag but my car has it.  Car driving is not my hobby it’s my feeling.I only love FAST CARS because I don’t believe slow and steady wins the race.
            The car has become an article of dress without which we feel uncertain, unclad, and incomplete in the urban compound.I race to win.If I am on the bike or in a car it will always be the same.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">“A motorcycle is like a drug but it doesn’t clog your arteries, impair your brain function, or send you to a rehabilitation centre. Plus, it’s completely legal (if you have a licence).” Yeah, that was my creation haha.
            Motorcycling is an amazing lifestyle that needs to be celebrated once in a while. One way to do this is through sharing one of these more popular motorcycle riding quotes:
            1) “Doesn’t matter what you ride, give respect to get respect”
            2) “Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery; Ride and live today”
            3) “If you want to be happy for a day, drink.
               If you want to be happy for a year, marry.
               If you want to be happy for a lifetime, ride a motorcycle.”
            4) “You don’t stop riding when you get old, you get old when you stop riding.”
            5) “Life is not about waiting for the storms to pass: it’s about learning how to ride in the rain!”
            6) “A bike on the road is worth two in the shed.”
            7) “You are on your own. You are not protected by two tons of steel, rubber, foam padding and safety glass. Neither are you steering two tons of guided missile toward other cars, people and property. If you are prepared to accept the responsibility of your own actions, then motorcycling can be both safe and thrilling. Riding is an art as well as a craft and no amount of explanation can take the place of experience.
